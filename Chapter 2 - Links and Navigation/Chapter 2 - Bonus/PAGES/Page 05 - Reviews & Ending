                <li>&#9733; 9/10 - Future Cult Classic</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Every scene of this film wowed me at TIFF. The casting, atmosphere, visual and sound design, 
                music, and, of course, the symbolism of it all. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley couldn't have been more perfectly 
                cast as leads. Their devotion to the process and trust in their director was clear to me. Their vulnerability pulls 
                this off and leads to a very compelling fever dream. Everyone involved should be really proud of this film. 
                To me, it's a future cult classic.</p>

                <li>&#9733; 10/10 - My Single Most Memorable Movie Experience</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                And I've seen thousands. I estimate about 5k movies in my 39 years on this earth. I can't remember one ever hitting 
                me this hard. I was sweating when it finished, even in a cool auditorium. Words to describe how I feel (until now, 
                a full hour after): shocked, floored, stuck, traumatized (in a good way?). This movie affected me. It destroyed me. As 
                soon as the credits rolled, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, saying things like wow, omg, wth, 
                BRO, while laughing in shock. These are random people I don't know. We continued to discuss it afterwards. That's never 
                happened to me before.

                <li>&#9733; 8/10 - Closed My Eyes in the Icky Parts</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This movie really stuck with me for a while and was thought provoking. Luckily at the grotesque bits I was looking 
                away so I wasn't plagued by nightmares like the other person I watched it with. There are very graphic scenes, but 
                I feel it added to the campiness and I didn't see the really gross ones. The message was clear cut and necessary 
                in this day and age. My only real question that I never felt was addressed was how separate and connected their 
                minds were, overall they both acted as entirely separate beings and I thought part of the point was that they were 
                the same being but the disconnect between the characters mentally and their actions and how they affected each other 
                was surprising.

            </ol>
            <p>
                I was extremely hyped for that movie even though I'm not a big fan of Fargeat's debut film "Revenge". 
                I liked her as a director, but not as a screenwriter. While that movie had interesting visual style, the 
                screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting. However she improved a lot from her last movie. 
                "The Substance" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well 
                thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for "The Substance"), 
                the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters' determination to achieve 
                their goals.

                <li>&#9733; 10/10 - Great Message That You Are Beautiful!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The better version of you is you. Not to be someone else nor someone younger or prettier. I like the message that packed 
                in sarcastic way. At the end of the day, you need to choose, your own beauty or beauty with the monster within. Getting 
                older and not pretty anymore is natural. Getting less famous and attractive is the consequences of life. Be grateful of 
                what you have, and being not satisfy with what we have, only will lead us to the disaster. And remember karma does exist. 
                You plant flowers, you will see the beauty. So, it is worth to watch. You will not see scary thing if you understand the 
                message.
