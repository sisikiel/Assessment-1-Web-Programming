                <b>Director & Writer</b> <br>The Substance is directed by Coralie Fargeat, a French filmmaker known for her work in the 
                horror genre. She gained international attention with her 2017 film Revenge, a brutal and feminist take on the rape-revenge 
                genre. Fargeat is known for her strong visual style and subverting traditional horror tropes. In The Substance, she continues 
                to explore themes of bodily autonomy, societal expectations, and the consequences of self-inflicted harm. She also wrote the 
                screenplay, showcasing her unique voice in combining horror with satirical social commentary.

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Genre</b> <br>The film is a mix of body horror, psychological horror, and satire, a combination that makes it both unsettling 
                and thought-provoking. It delves into the extreme consequences of the beauty industry and society's obsession with youth. The 
                body horror elements are amplified by grotesque transformations, while the psychological horror examines the internal and 
                emotional struggle of the characters. Additionally, there’s a sharp critique of the entertainment industry, particularly its 
                exploitation of women as they age.

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Production</b> <br>The film was produced by Neon, a company known for its innovative and daring films, such as Parasite 
                (2019) and The Lighthouse (2019). The production involved intense work with practical special effects, including extensive 
                prosthetics and makeup to portray the physical transformation of the characters. The movie also utilized 21,000 liters of 
                fake blood, making the effects both impressive and unsettling.

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Cinematography & Visual Sytles</b> <br>The Substance is noted for its striking visual style. The cinematography is lush, 
                using vibrant colors to emphasize the contrast between youth and decay. The film often uses extreme close-ups to accentuate 
                the grotesque and horrifying transformations of the characters, making the viewer feel uncomfortable and trapped in the 
                experience. Fargeat's direction keeps the audience engaged with surreal, almost dreamlike sequences, creating a sense of 
                dread that is visually intense.
            </div>

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Music</b> <br>The soundtrack features a mix of eerie, atmospheric music and more upbeat, almost ironic tunes, underscoring 
                the tension between the film’s satirical tone and its horrific content. The soundtrack contributes to the film’s unsettling 
                vibe, with music that contrasts the on-screen chaos, reinforcing the psychological aspect of the narrative.

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Production Design</b> <br>The film’s production design carefully balances a luxurious yet sterile aesthetic, showing the 
                high-glamour world of celebrity alongside the dark, hidden consequences of seeking perfection. The contrast in design between 
                Elisabeth’s old life and Sue’s rise to fame adds to the tension between the two characters.
