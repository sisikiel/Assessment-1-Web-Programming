        <h2 id="PLOT">What twisted fate awaits those who seek <i>The Substance?</i> Read the Synopsis to this mystery:</h2>
        <p class="p-style1">
            <b>Elisabeth Sparkle</b>, a former television star, finds herself discarded by the entertainment industry on her 50th birthday, 
            deemed too old for the spotlight. Desperate to reclaim her youth, beauty, and relevance, she turns to an experimental 
            serum known as "The Substance." This mysterious formula allows her to create a younger, more vibrant version of herself 
            named <b>Sue</b>. However, the process comes with strict rules—Elisabeth and Sue must share one body, alternating consciousness 
            every seven days. <br>

            <br>At first, Elisabeth enjoys the benefits of her youthful alter ego, as Sue quickly rises to stardom, captivating audiences 
            and industry elites. However, as Sue thrives, Elisabeth begins to deteriorate, aging at an accelerated rate each time she 
            reclaims control of their shared body. Over time, resentment festers between them, as Sue becomes increasingly independent, 
            reckless, and unwilling to relinquish her time in the spotlight. <br>
            
            <br>Desperate to maintain her newfound fame, Sue starts abusing The Substance, taking extra doses to extend her time in control. 
            This dangerous overuse throws the delicate balance into chaos, causing Elisabeth’s body to decay unnaturally. As her 
            desperation reaches its peak, Sue takes an extreme risk—an overdose of the serum in a final bid to permanently erase Elisabeth. 
            Instead, the overdose triggers a horrifying consequence: the two identities merge into a grotesque, monstrous fusion of youth 
            and decay, an abomination known as "Monstro Elisasue." <br>
            
            <br>The transformation reaches its climax during a highly publicized live television event, where the horrific fusion is revealed 
            in front of an unsuspecting audience. In a nightmarish spectacle, the grotesque, deformed entity rampages on stage, exposing 
            the brutal consequences of society’s obsession with youth and perfection. The moment serves as a macabre satire of the 
            entertainment industry, exposing the extreme lengths individuals are willing to go to in pursuit of beauty and relevance.

        <h2 id="KEY">What are some basic infos you have to know about this movie?</h2>

        <div class="flex-container"> <!--main box container-->
            <div class="flex-box"> <!--small boxes under the main box-->
                <b>Director & Writer</b> <br>The Substance is directed by Coralie Fargeat, a French filmmaker known for her work in the 
                horror genre. She gained international attention with her 2017 film Revenge, a brutal and feminist take on the rape-revenge 
                genre. Fargeat is known for her strong visual style and subverting traditional horror tropes. In The Substance, she continues 
                to explore themes of bodily autonomy, societal expectations, and the consequences of self-inflicted harm. She also wrote the 
                screenplay, showcasing her unique voice in combining horror with satirical social commentary.
            </div>

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Genre</b> <br>The film is a mix of body horror, psychological horror, and satire, a combination that makes it both unsettling 
                and thought-provoking. It delves into the extreme consequences of the beauty industry and society's obsession with youth. The 
                body horror elements are amplified by grotesque transformations, while the psychological horror examines the internal and 
                emotional struggle of the characters. Additionally, there’s a sharp critique of the entertainment industry, particularly its 
                exploitation of women as they age.
            </div>

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Production</b> <br>The film was produced by Neon, a company known for its innovative and daring films, such as Parasite 
                (2019) and The Lighthouse (2019). The production involved intense work with practical special effects, including extensive 
                prosthetics and makeup to portray the physical transformation of the characters. The movie also utilized 21,000 liters of 
                fake blood, making the effects both impressive and unsettling.
            </div>

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Cinematography & Visual Sytles</b> <br>The Substance is noted for its striking visual style. The cinematography is lush, 
                using vibrant colors to emphasize the contrast between youth and decay. The film often uses extreme close-ups to accentuate 
                the grotesque and horrifying transformations of the characters, making the viewer feel uncomfortable and trapped in the 
                experience. Fargeat's direction keeps the audience engaged with surreal, almost dreamlike sequences, creating a sense of 
                dread that is visually intense.
            </div>

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Music</b> <br>The soundtrack features a mix of eerie, atmospheric music and more upbeat, almost ironic tunes, underscoring 
                the tension between the film’s satirical tone and its horrific content. The soundtrack contributes to the film’s unsettling 
                vibe, with music that contrasts the on-screen chaos, reinforcing the psychological aspect of the narrative.
            </div>

            <div class="flex-box">
                <b>Production Design</b> <br>The film’s production design carefully balances a luxurious yet sterile aesthetic, showing the 
                high-glamour world of celebrity alongside the dark, hidden consequences of seeking perfection. The contrast in design between 
                Elisabeth’s old life and Sue’s rise to fame adds to the tension between the two characters.

                <li>&#9733; 9/10 - Future Cult Classic</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>Every scene of this film wowed me at TIFF. The casting, atmosphere, visual and sound design, 
                music, and, of course, the symbolism of it all. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley couldn't have been more perfectly 
                cast as leads. Their devotion to the process and trust in their director was clear to me. Their vulnerability pulls 
                this off and leads to a very compelling fever dream. Everyone involved should be really proud of this film. 
                To me, it's a future cult classic.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>
                And I've seen thousands. I estimate about 5k movies in my 39 years on this earth. I can't remember one ever hitting 
                me this hard. I was sweating when it finished, even in a cool auditorium. Words to describe how I feel (until now, 
                a full hour after): shocked, floored, stuck, traumatized (in a good way?). This movie affected me. It destroyed me. As 
                soon as the credits rolled, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, saying things like wow, omg, wth, 
                BRO, while laughing in shock. These are random people I don't know. We continued to discuss it afterwards. That's never 
                happened to me before.

            </ol>
            <p>
                This movie really stuck with me for a while and was thought provoking. Luckily at the grotesque bits I was looking 
                away so I wasn't plagued by nightmares like the other person I watched it with. There are very graphic scenes, but 
                I feel it added to the campiness and I didn't see the really gross ones. The message was clear cut and necessary 
                in this day and age. My only real question that I never felt was addressed was how separate and connected their 
                minds were, overall they both acted as entirely separate beings and I thought part of the point was that they were 
                the same being but the disconnect between the characters mentally and their actions and how they affected each other 
                was surprising.

            </ol>
            <p>
                I was extremely hyped for that movie even though I'm not a big fan of Fargeat's debut film "Revenge". 
                I liked her as a director, but not as a screenwriter. While that movie had interesting visual style, the 
                screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting. However she improved a lot from her last movie. 
                "The Substance" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well 
                thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for "The Substance"), 
                the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters' determination to achieve 
                their goals.

                <li>&#9733; 10/10 - Great Message That You Are Beautiful!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The better version of you is you. Not to be someone else nor someone younger or prettier. I like the message that packed 
                in sarcastic way. At the end of the day, you need to choose, your own beauty or beauty with the monster within. Getting 
                older and not pretty anymore is natural. Getting less famous and attractive is the consequences of life. Be grateful of 
                what you have, and being not satisfy with what we have, only will lead us to the disaster. And remember karma does exist. 
                You plant flowers, you will see the beauty. So, it is worth to watch. You will not see scary thing if you understand the 
                message.
